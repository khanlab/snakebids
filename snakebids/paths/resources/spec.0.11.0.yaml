description: |
  Spec corresponding to `BIDS v1.9.0`_.

  Significantly expanded from the v0.0.0 spec, now including long names for
  every relevant entity. In addition to the official spec, it includes `from`
  and `to` entities intended for transformations. Unknown entities are placed
  just before desc, so that the description entity is always last.
