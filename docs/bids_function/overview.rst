Overview
========

The ``bids`` function generates a BIDS-like filepath corresponding to its keyword arguments. The generated filepath has the form::

    [root]/[sub-{subject}]/[ses-{session]/[prefix]_[sub-{subject}]_[ses-{session}]_[{key}-{val}_ ... ]_[suffix]

Use cases of the ``bids`` function include, at simplest, replacing a hard-coded BIDS file with an invocation of the ``bids`` function, so ::

    "data/sub-01/ses-01/func/sub-01_ses-01_task-rest_acq-01_run-1_bold.nii.gz"

could become ::

    bids(
        root="data",
        subject="01",
        session="01",
        datatype="func",
        task="rest",
        acq="01",
        run="1",
        suffix="bold.nii.gz"
    )

If you wanted to specify that a rule should run on a BIDS file from any subject, session, acquisition, task, and run, you could change those keyword arguments to be snakemake wildcards::

    bids(
        root="data",
        subject="{subject}",
        session="{session}",
        datatype="func",
        task="{task}",
        acq="{acq}",
        run="{run}",
        suffix="bold.nii.gz"
    )

Using the subject and session keywords as wildcards is common enough that snakebids pre-populates a config variable (``subj_wildcards``) with these wildcards, allowing the ``bids`` call to look like the following::

    bids(
        root="data",
        datatype="func",
        task="{task}",
        acq="{acq}",
        run="{run}",
        suffix="bold.nii.gz",
        **inputs.subj_wildcards
    )

Now if you want to process all inputs of a given form regardless of how their wildcards resolve, you can use :meth:`BidsComponent.expand <snakebids.BidsComponent.expand>` to expand over the entity-values found in your input dataset. As an example, to specify the output of a rule that preprocesses BOLD images (as specified in the example configuration), the following would resolve the subject, session, acquisition, task, and run wildcards::

    inputs["bold"].expand(
        bids(
            root="output",
            datatype="func",
            desc="preproc",
            acq="{acq}",
            task="{task}",
            run="{run}",
            **inputs.subj_wildcards
        ),
    )
