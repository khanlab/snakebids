Configuration
=============

Snakebids is configured with a YAML (or JSON) file that extends the standard [snakemake config file](https://snakemake.readthedocs.io/en/stable/snakefiles/configuration.html#standard-configuration) with variables that snakebids uses to parse an input BIDS dataset and expose the snakebids workflow to the command line.

Config Variables
----------------

### `pybids_inputs`

A dictionary that describes each type of input you want to grab from an input BIDS dataset. Snakebids will parse your dataset with {func}`generate_inputs() <snakebids.generate_inputs>`, converting each input type into a {class}`BidsComponent <snakebids.BidsComponent>`. The value of each item should be a dictionary with keys ``filters`` and ``wildcards``.

The value of ``filters`` should be a dictionary where each key corresponds to a BIDS entity, and the value specifies which values of that entity should be grabbed. The dictionary for each input is sent to the [PyBIDS' get() function ](pybids:bids.layout.BIDSLayout). `filters` can be set according to a few different formats:

* [string](python:str): specifies an exact value for the entity. In the following example:
  ```yaml
  pybids_inputs:
    bold:
      filters:
        suffix: 'bold'
        extension: '.nii.gz'
        datatype: 'func'
  ```
  the bold component would match any paths under the `func/` datatype folder, with the suffix `bold` and the extension `.nii.gz`.
  ```
  sub-xxx/.../func/ent1-xxx_ent2-xxx_..._bold.nii.gz
  ```
* [boolean](python:bool): constrains presence or absence of the entity without restricting its value. `False` requires that the entity be **absent**, while `True` requires that the  entity be **present**, regardless of value.
  ```yaml
  pybids_inputs:
    derivs:
      filters:
        datatype: 'func'
        desc: True # or true, or yes
        acquisition: False # or false, or no
  ```
  The above example maps all paths in the `func/` datatype folder that have a `_desc-` entity but do not have the `_acq-` entity.

In addition, the special filter `regex_search` can be set to `true`, which causes all other filters in the component to use regex matching instead of exact matching.

The value of ``wildcards`` should be a list of BIDS entities. Snakebids collects the values of any entities specified and saves them in the {attr}`entities <snakebids.BidsComponent.entities>` and `zip_lists` entries of the corresponding {class}`BidsComponent <snakebids.BidsComponent>`. In other words, these are the entities to be preserved in output paths derived from the input being described. Placing an entity in `wildcards` does not require the entity be present. If an entity is not found, it will be left out of {attr}`entities <snakebids.BidsComponent.entities>`. To require the presence of an entity, place it under `filters` set to `true`.

In the following (YAML-formatted) example, the ``bold`` input type is specified. BIDS files with the datatype ``func``, suffix ``bold``, and extension ``.nii.gz`` will be grabbed, and the ``subject``, ``session``, ``acquisition``, ``task``, and ``run`` entities of those files will be left as wildcards. The `task` entity must be present, but there must not be any `desc`.

```yaml
pybids_inputs:
  bold:
    filters:
      suffix: 'bold'
      extension: '.nii.gz'
      datatype: 'func'
      task: true
      desc: false
    wildcards:
      - subject
      - session
      - acquisition
      - task
      - run
```

### `pybids_db_dir`

PyBIDS allows for the use of a cached layout to be used in order to reduce the time required to index a BIDS dataset. A path (if provided) to save the ``PyBIDS`` layout. If ``None`` or ``''`` is provided, the layout is not saved / used. The path provided must be absolute, otherwise the database will not be used. Note, this is a variable used for an opt-in feature and must first be uncommented in the ``snakebids.yml`` file.

### `pybids_db_reset`
A boolean determining whether the existing layout should be be updated. Default behaviour does not update the existing database if one is used. Note, this is a variable used for an opt-in feature and must first be uncommented in the ``snakebids.yml`` file.

### `analysis_levels`

A list of analysis levels in the BIDS app. Typically, this will include participant and/or group. Note that the default (YAML) configuration file expects this mapping to be identified with the anchor ``analysis_levels`` to be aliased by ``parse_args``.


### `targets_by_analysis_level`

A mapping from the name of each ``analysis_level`` to the list of rules or files to be run for that analysis level.


### `parse_args`

A dictionary of command-line parameters to make available as part of the BIDS app. Each item of the mapping is passed to [argparse's add_argument function](https://docs.python.org/3/library/argparse.html#the-add-argument-method). A number of default entries are present in a new snakebids project's config file that structure the BIDS app's CLI, but additional command-line arguments can be added as necessary.


### `debug`

A boolean that determines whether debug statements are printed during parsing. Should be disabled (False) if you're generating DAG visualization with snakemake.


### `derivatives`

A boolean (or path(s) to derivatives datasets) that determines whether snakebids will search in the derivatives subdirectory of the input dataset.
