Workflows
=========

Snakebids workflows are constructed the same way as any other [Snakemake workflows](inv:snakemake#snakefiles/rules), but with a few additions that make it easier to work with BIDS datasets.

To get access to these additions, the base Snakefile for a snakebids workflow should begin with the following boilerplate:

```python
import snakebids
from snakebids import bids

configfile: 'config/snakebids.yml'

# Get input wildcards
inputs = snakebids.generate_inputs(
    bids_dir=config["bids_dir"],
    pybids_inputs=config["pybids_inputs"],
    pybids_database_dir=config.get("pybids_db_dir"),
    pybids_reset_database=config.get("pybids_db_reset"),
    derivatives=config.get("derivatives"),
    participant_label=config.get("participant_label"),
    exclude_participant_label=config.get("exclude_participant_label"),
)

```

Snakebids workflow features
---------------------------

The [](#snakebids.bids) function generates a properly-formatted BIDS filename with the specified entities, as documented in more detail elsewhere in this documentation.

[](#snakebids.generate_inputs) returns an instance of [](#snakebids.BidsDataset), a special <inv:*:*:class#dict> with keys mapping to the {class}`BidsComponents <snakebids.BidsComponent>` defined in [the config file](/bids_app/config). Each {class}`~snakebids.BidsComponent` contains a number of attributes to assist processing a BIDS dataset with snakemake. {func}`~snakebids.generate_inputs` should be called at the beginning of the workflow and assigned to a variable called `inputs`.

The {attr}`~snakebids.BidsComponent.path` member of {class}`~snakebids.BidsComponent` is generated by snakebids and contains a list of matched files for every input type. Often, the first rule to be invoked will use one or more entries in `inputs.path` as the input file specification.

The {meth}`~snakebids.BidsComponent.expand` method of {class}`~snakebids.BidsComponent` is used to expand over files using only the entity-values found in your dataset. A usage pattern is as follows:

```py
inputs["bold"].expand(
    bids(
        root="results",
        datatype="func",
        suffix="func.shape.gii",
        hemi="{hemi}",
        **inputs.wildcards["bold"]
    ),
    hemi=config["hemi"],
)
```

Extra entities provided to [`BidsComponent.expand()`](#snakebids.BidsComponent.expand) will expand the path across every possible combination of values, just like in the snakemake [`expand()`](#snakefiles_expand).

By default, [`BidsComponent.expand()`](#snakebids.BidsComponent.expand) allows partial expansion over paths. In other words, it will not raise an error if some wildcards in the path are missing from your arguments. This is contrary to the snakemake behaviour, which by default raises an error in such cases. To require all wildcards in the path to be filled, set the `allow_missing` argument in [`BidsComponent.expand()`](#snakebids.BidsComponent.expand) to `False`.

The {attr}`~snakebids.BidsComponent.wildcards` member of {class}`~snakebids.BidsComponent` is generated by snakebids and contains a dictionary mapping the wildcards for each input type to snakemake-formatted wildcards, for convenient use in the ``bids`` function.


## Accessing the underlying *pybids* dataset

In addition to mapping all of the {class}`BidsComponents <snakebids.BidsComponent>` to their names, {class}`~snakebids.BidsDataset` also has a {attr}`~snakebids.BidsDataset.layout` member which gives access to the underlying {class}`BIDSLayout <bids.layout.BIDSLayout>`. This can be used to access advanced pybids features not covered by `snakebids`. Note that if `custom_paths` are specified for every {class}`BidsComponent <snakebids.BidsComponent>`, pybids indexing will be skipped and {attr}`~snakebids.BidsDataset.layout` will be set to `None`. If your workflow relies on accessing this {attr}`~snakebids.BidsDataset.layout`, you must ensure your users do not provide a `custom_path` for every single component, either in the config file or [via the CLI](/running_snakebids/overview) (``--path_{component}``).
