## Getting started

In this example we will make a workflow to smooth ``bold`` scans from a bids dataset.

We will start by creating a simple rule, then make this more generalizable in each step. To begin with, this is the command we are using to smooth a bold scan.

    fslmaths ../bids/sub-001/func/sub-001_task-rest_run-1_bold.nii.gz -s 2.12 results/sub-001/func/sub-001_task-rest_run-1_fwhm-5mm_bold.nii.gz

This command performs smoothing with a sigma=2.12 Gaussian kernel (equivalent to 5mm FWHM, with sigma=fwhm/2.355), and saves the smoothed file as ``results/sub-001/func/sub-001_task-rest_run-1_fwhm-5mm_bold.nii.gz``.

### Installation

Start by making a new directory:

```console
$ mkdir snakebids-tutorial
$ cd snakebids-tutorial
```

Check your python version to make sure you have at least version 3.7 or higher:
```console
$ python --version
Python 3.10.0
```

Make a new virtual environment:

```console
$ python -m venv .venv
$ source activate .venv/bin/activate
```

And use pip to install snakebids:

```console
$ pip install snakebids
```

In our example, we'll be using the [`fslmaths`](https://fsl.fmrib.ox.ac.uk/fsl/fslwiki/Fslutils) tool from [*FSL*](https://fsl.fmrib.ox.ac.uk/fsl/fslwiki/). If you want to actually run the workflow, you'll need to have FSL installed. This is not actually necessary to follow along the tutorial however, as we can use "dry runs" to see what snakemake *would* do if FSL were installed.

### Getting the dataset

We will be running the tutorial on a test dataset consisting only of empty files. We won't actually be able to run our workflow on it (`fslmaths` will fail), but as mentioned above, we can use dry runs to see would would normally happen.

If you wish to follow along using the same dataset, currently the easiest way is to start by cloning snakebids:

```console
$ git clone https://github.com/akhanf/snakebids.git
```

Then copy the following directory:

```console
$ cp -r snakebids/docs/tutorial/bids ./data
```

It's also perfectly possible (and probably better!) to try the tutorial on your own dataset. Just adjust any paths below so that they match your data!

Part I: Snakemake
====================

(step_0)=
## Step 0: a basic non-generic workflow

In this rule, we start by creating a rule that is effectively hard-coding the paths for input and output to re-create the command as above.

In this rule we have an ``input:`` section for input **files**, a ``params:`` section for **non-file**  parameters, and an ``output:`` section for output files. The shell section is used to build the shell command, and can refer to the input, output or params using curly braces. Note that any of these can also be named inputs, but we have only used this for the ``sigma`` parameter in this case.

```{literalinclude} step0/Snakefile
  :language: python
  :linenos:
  :caption: Snakefile
```

With this rule in our Snakefile, we can then run ``snakemake -np`` to execute a dry-run of the workflow. Here the ``-n`` specifies dry-run, and the ``-p`` prints any shell commands that are to be executed.

```{asciinema} step0/step0.cast
```

When we invoke ``snakemake``, it uses the first rule in the snakefile as the ``target`` rule. The target rule is what snakemake uses as a starting point to determine what other rules need to be run in order to generate the inputs. We'll learn a bit more about that in the next step.

So far, we just have a fancy way of specifying the exact same command we started with, so there is no added benefit (yet). But we will soon add to this rule to make it more generalizable.

(step_1)=
## Step 1: adding wildcards

First step to make the workflow generalizeable is to replace the hard-coded identifiers (e.g. the subject, task and run) with wildcards.

In the Snakefile, we can replace `sub-001` with `sub-{subject}`, and so forth for task and run.  Now the rule is generic for any subject, task, or run.

```{literalinclude} step1/Snakefile
  :language: python
  :linenos:
  :caption: Snakefile
  :emphasize-lines: 3,7
```

However, if we try to execute (dry-run) the workflow as before, we get an error. This is because the ``target`` rule now has wildcards in it. So snakemake is unable to determine what rules need to be run to generate the inputs, since the wildcards can take any value.

```{asciinema} step1/step1.cast
```

So for the time being, we will make use of the snakemake command-line argument to specify ``targets``, and specify the file we want generated from the command-line, by running:

```console
$ snakemake -np results/sub-001/func/sub-001_task-rest_run-1_fwhm-5mm_bold.nii.gz
```

We can now even try running this for another subject by changing the target file.

```console
$ snakemake -np results/sub-002/func/sub-002_task-rest_run-1_fwhm-5mm_bold.nii.gz
```

Try using a subject that doesn't exist in our bids dataset, what happens?

Now, try changing the output smoothing value, e.g. ``fwhm-10mm``, and see what happens.
As expected the command still uses a smoothing value of 2.12, since that has been hard-coded, but we will see how to rectify this in the next step.

(step_2)=
## Step 2: adding a params function

As we noted, the sigma parameter needs to be computed from the FWHM. We can use a function to do this. Functions can be used for any ``input`` or ``params``, and must take ``wildcards`` as an input argument, which provides a mechanism to pass the wildcards (determined from the output file) to the function.

We can thus define a simple function that returns a string representing ``FWHM/2.355`` as follows:


```{literalinclude} step2/Snakefile
:lines: 1-2
:caption: Snakefile
:linenos:
```

Note 1: We now have to make the fwhm in the output filename a wildcard, so that it can be passed to the function (via the wildcards object).

Note 2: We have to convert the fwhm to float, since all wildcards are always strings (since they are parsed from the output filename).

Once we have this function, we can replace the hardcoded ``2.12`` with the name of the function:

```{literalinclude} step2/Snakefile
    :lines: 6-9
    :caption: Snakefile
    :linenos:
    :lineno-start: 6
    :emphasize-lines: 3
```

Here is the full Snakefile:

```{literalinclude} step2/Snakefile
    :language: python
    :caption: Snakefile
    :linenos:
```

Now try running the workflow again, with `fwhm-5` as well as `fwhm-10`.

```{asciinema} step2/step2.cast
```

(step_3)=
## Step 3: adding a target rule

Now we have a generic rule, but it is pretty tedious to have to type out the filename of each target from the command-line in order to use it.

This is where target rules come in. If you recall from earlier, the first rule in a workflow is interpreted as the target rule, so we just need to add a dummy rule to the Snakefile that has all the target files as inputs. It is a dummy rule since it doesn't have any outputs or any command to run itself, but snakemake will take these input files, and determine if any other rules in the workflow can generate them (considering any wildcards too).

In this case, we have a BIDS dataset with two runs (run-1, run-2), and suppose we wanted to compute smoothing with several different FWHM kernels (5,10,15,20). We can thus make a target rule that has all these resulting filenames as inputs.

A very useful function in snakemake is [`expand()`][expand_func]. It is a way to perform array expansion to create lists of strings (input filenames).


```{literalinclude} step3/Snakefile
    :language: python
    :caption: Snakefile
    :linenos:
    :lines: 1-11
```

Now, we don't need to specify any targets from the command-line, and can just run:

```console
$ snakemake -np
```

```{asciinema} step3/step3.cast
```

The entire Snakefile for reference is:

```{literalinclude} step3/Snakefile
    :language: python
    :caption: Snakefile
    :linenos:
```

(step_4)=
## Step 4: adding a config file

We have a functional workflow, but suppose you need to configure or run it on another bids dataset with different subjects, tasks, runs, or you want to run it for different smoothing values. You have to actually modify your workflow in order to do this.

It is a better practice instead to keep your configuration variables separate from the actual workflow. Snakemake supports this by allowing for a separate config file (can be YAML or JSON, here we will use YAML), where we can store any dataset specific configuration. Then to apply it for a new purpose, you can simply update the config file.

To do this, we simply add a line to our workflow:

```{literalinclude} step4/Snakefile
  :language: python
  :caption: Snakefile
  :linenos:
  :emphasize-lines: 1
  :lines: 1-4
```

Snakemake will then handle reading it in, and making the configuration variables available via dictionary called ``config``.

In our config file, we will add variables for everything in the target rule [`expand()`][expand_func]:


```{literalinclude} step4/config.yml
:language: yaml
:caption: config.yaml
:linenos:
```

In our Snakefile, we then need to replace these hardcoded values with ``config[key]``. The entire updated Snakefile is shown here:

```{literalinclude} step4/Snakefile
  :language: python
  :caption: Snakefile
  :linenos:
```

After these changes, the workflow should still run just like the last step, but now you can make any changes via the config file.

```{asciinema} step4/step4.cast
```


Part II: Snakebids
==================

Now that we have a fully functioning and generic Snakemake workflow, let's see what Snakebids can add.

(step_5)=
## Step 5: the bids() function

The first thing we can make use of is the {func}`~snakebids.bids` function. This provides an easy way to generate bids filenames. This is especially useful when defining output files in your workflow and you have many bids entities.

In our existing workflow, this was our output file:


```{literalinclude} step4/Snakefile
  :language: python
  :caption: Snakefile
  :linenos:
  :start-at: output
  :end-before: shell
  :lineno-match:
```

To create the same path using {func}`bids() <snakebids.bids>`, we just need to specify the root directory (`results`), all the bids tags (subject, task, run, fwhm), and the suffix (which includes the extension):

```{literalinclude} step5/Snakefile
:language: python
:linenos:
:caption: Snakefile
:start-at: output
:end-before: shell
:lineno-match:
```



```{note}
To make a snakemake wildcard, we wrapped the `'value'` in curly braces (e.g. `'{value}'`).
```

```{note}
The entities you supply in the {func}`bids() <snakebids.bids>` function do not have to be in the BIDS specification, e.g. ``fwhm`` is not in the spec. But if you do use entities that are in the BIDS specification, snakebids will ensure they go in the correct order (e.g. `sub_*-ses_*-run_*...`). Non-standard entities will be added to the end of the path, just before the suffix, in the order they were defined.
```

The Snakefile with the output filename replaced (in both rules) is below:

```{literalinclude} step5/Snakefile
  :language: python
  :linenos:
  :caption: Snakefile
```


## Step 6: parsing the BIDS dataset

So far, we have had to manually enter the path to input bold file in the config file, and also specify what subjects, tasks, and runs we want processed. Can't we use the fact that we have a BIDS dataset to automate this a bit more?

With Snakemake, there are ways to glob the files to figure out what wildcards are present (e.g. [`glob_wildcards()`](inv:snakemake#glob-wildcards)), however, this is not so straightforward with BIDS, since filenames in BIDS often have optional components. E.g. some datasets may have a `ses` tag/sub-directory, and others do not. Also there are often optional user-defined values, such as the `acq` tag, that a workflow in most cases should ignore. Thus, the input that we use in our workflow, `in_bold`, that has wildcards to be generic, would need to be altered for any given BIDS dataset, along with the workflow itself, making this automated BIDS parsing difficult within Snakemake.

Snakebids lets you parse a bids dataset (using [pybids](inv:pybids:std:doc#index) under the hood) using a configfile that contains the required wildcards, along with data structures that specify all the wildcard values for all the subjects. This, in combination with the {func}`bids() <snakebids.bids>` function, can allow one to make snakemake workflows that are compatible with any general bids dataset.

To add this parsing to the workflow, we call the {func}`generate_inputs() <snakebids.generate_inputs()>` function before our rules are defined, and pass along some configuration data to specify the location of the bids directory (`bids_dir`) and the inputs we want to parse for the workflow (`pybids_inputs`). The function returns a {class}`BidsDataset <snakebids.BidsDataset>`, which we'll assign to a variable called `inputs`:


```{literalinclude} step6/Snakefile
:language: python
:linenos:
:caption: Snakefile
:end-before: print(inputs)
:emphasize-lines: 1, 5-9
```


```{note}
Snakebids has transitioned to a new format for {func}`generate_inputs() <snakebids.generate_inputs()>`. To get access to the old dict style return, the `use_bids_inputs` parameter must be set to False. A tutorial for the old syntax can be found on [the v0.5.0 docs](https://snakebids.readthedocs.io/en/v0.5.0/tutorial/tutorial.html#part-ii-snakebids).
```


The config variables we need pre-defined are as follows::

```{literalinclude} step6/config.yml
:language: yaml
:linenos:
:caption: config.yml
:emphasize-lines: 1, 9-20
```


The `pybids_inputs` dict defines what types of inputs the workflow can make use of (i.e. the top-level keys, `bold` in this case), and for each input, how to filter for them (i.e. the `filters` dict), and what BIDS entities to replace with wildcards in the snakemake workflow (i.e. the `wildcards` dict).

```{note}
The ``filters`` dict is passed directly to the [`get()`](<inv:pybids#bids.layout.BIDSLayout>) function in [pybids](inv:pybids#index), and thus is quite customizable.
```

```{note}
Entries in the `wildcards` list do not have to be in your bids dataset, but if they are, then they will be converted into wildcards (i.e. `task-{task}`) if they are in the filenames. The names for these also correspond with pybids (e.g. `acquisition` maps to `acq`).
```

The {class}`BidsDataset <snakebids.BidsDataset>` class returned by {func}`generate_inputs() <snakebids.generate_inputs>` summarizes the wildcards found in your bids dataset and has parameters to plug those wildcards into your workflow. To investigate it, add a print statement following `generate_inputs(...)`:

```{literalinclude} step6/Snakefile
:language: python
:linenos:
:caption: Snakefile
:end-before: rule all
:emphasize-lines: 11
```

Run the workflow:

```console
$ snakemake -nq
BidsDataset({
    "bold": BidsComponent(
        name="bold",
        path="/path/to/data/sub-{subject}/func/sub-{subject}_task-{task}_run-{run}_bold.nii.gz",
        zip_lists={
            "subject": ["001",  "001" ],
            "task":    ["rest", "rest"],
            "run":     ["1",    "2"   ],
        },
    ),
})
```

%TODO: add asciinema

As you can see, {class}`BidsDataset <snakebids.BidsDataset>` is just a special kind of {class}`dict`. Its keys refer to the names of the input types you specified in the config file (in `pybids_inputs`). You can test this by running `print(list(inputs.keys))`{l=python}. Each value contains an object summarizing that input type. We refer to these input types, and the objects that describe them, as {class}`BidsComponents <snakebids.BidsComponent>`.

Each {class}`BidsComponent <snakebids.BidsComponent>` has three primary attributes. {attr}`.name <snakebids.BidsComponent.name>` is the name of the component, this will be the same as the dictionary key in the dataset. {attr}`.path <snakebids.BidsComponent.path>` is the generic path of the component. Note the wildcards: `{subject}`, `{task}`, and `{run}`. These wildcards can be substituted for values that will uniquely define each specific path. {attr}`.zip_lists <snakebids.BidsComponent.zip_lists>` contains these unique values. It's a simple {class}`dict` whose keys are bids entities and whose values are {attr}`lists <list>` of entity-values. Note the tabular format that printed in your console: each of the columns of this "table" correspond to the entity-values of one specific file.

Notice that `inputs['bold'].path`{l=python} is the same as the path we wrote under `in_bold:` in our `config.yaml` file in [step 4](#step_4). In fact, we can go ahead and replace `config['in_bold']`{l=python} in our `Snakemake` file with `inputs['bold'].path`{l=python} and delete `in_bold` from `config.yaml`.

```{literalinclude} step6/Snakefile
:language: python
:linenos:
:caption: Snakefile
:start-at: rule smooth
:end-at: params
:lineno-match:
:emphasize-lines: 3
```


## Step 7: using input wildcards

{attr}`BidsComponent.path <snakebids.BidsComponent.path>` already grants us a lot of flexibility, but we can still do more! In addition to the three main attributes of {class}`BidsComponents <snakebids.BidsComponent>` already described, the class offers a number of special properties we can use in our workflows. First, we'll look at {attr}`BidsComponent.wildcards <snakebids.BidsComponent.wildcards>`. This is a dict that maps each entity to the brace-wrapped `{wildcards}` we specified in `pybids_config`. If you printed this value in our test workflow, it would look like this:

```py
inputs['bold'].wildcards == {
    'subject': '{subject}',
    'task': '{task}',
    'run': '{run}'
}
```

This is super useful when combined with {func}`bids() <snakebids.bids>`, as we can use the keyword expansion `**inputs["<input_name>"].wildcards`{l=python} to set all the wildcard parameters to the {func}`bids() <snakebids.bids>` function. Thus, we can make our workflow even more general, by replacing this:

```{literalinclude} step6/Snakefile
:language: python
:linenos:
:caption: Snakefile
:start-at: rule smooth
:end-at: fslmaths {input}
:lineno-match:
:emphasize-lines: 9-11
```

with this:

```{literalinclude} step7/Snakefile
:language: python
:linenos:
:caption: Snakefile
:start-at: rule smooth
:end-at: fslmaths {input}
:lineno-match:
:emphasize-lines: 11
```

This effectively ensures that any bids entities from the input filenames (that are listed as pybids wildcards) get carried over to the output filenames. Note that we still have the ability to add on additional entities, such as `fwhm` here, and set the root directory and suffix.

Another useful property is {attr}`.entities <snakebids.BidsComponent.entities>`. This is a {class}`dict` mapping each entity to the list of all values that it could take:

```py
inputs['bold'].entities == {
    'subject': ['001'],
    'task': ['rest'],
    'run': ['1', '2'],
}
```

This is a useful dict to use with [`expand()`][expand_func] in a target rule, letting us avoid having to specify e.g. the run numbers or task names in the config, and rely on pybids to determine these:

```{literalinclude} step7/Snakefile
:language: python
:linenos:
:caption: Snakefile
:start-at: rule all
:end-before: def calc
:lineno-match:
:emphasize-lines: 11
```


```{note}
Since `expand()` will by default use all combinations of these, this can lead to snakemake searching for inputs that do not exist (e.g. if only one of your subjects has run-2). In this case, you want to use {attr}`BidsComponent.zip_lists <snakebids.BidsComponent.zip_lists>` instead).
%TODO: maybe just do this in a later step, and/or link to other docs..
```

For reference, here is the updated config file and Snakefile after these changes:

```{literalinclude} step7/config.yml
  :language: yaml
  :linenos:
  :caption: config.yml
```


```{literalinclude} step7/Snakefile
  :language: python
  :linenos:
  :caption: Snakefile
```

## Step 8: creating a command-line executable

Now that we have pybids parsing to dynamically configure our workflow inputs based on our BIDS dataset, we are ready to turn our workflow into a [BIDS App](http://bids-apps.neuroimaging.io/). BIDS Apps are command-line apps with a standardized interface (e.g. three required positional arguments: ``bids_directory``, ``output_directory``, and ``analysis_level``).

We do this in snakebids by creating an executable python script, which uses the {class}`SnakeBidsApp <snakebids.app.SnakeBidsApp>` class from {mod}`snakebids.app` to run snakemake. An example of this `run.py` script is shown below.

```{literalinclude} step8/run.py
  :language: python
  :linenos:
  :caption: run.py
```

However, we will first need to add some additional information to our config file, mainly to define how to parse command-line arguments for this app. This is done with a new `parse_args` dict in the config:

```{literalinclude} step8/config.yml
:language: yaml
:caption: config.yml
:linenos:
:start-at: parse_args
:lineno-match:
```

The above is standard boilerplate for any BIDS app.  You can also define any new command-line arguments you wish. Snakebids uses the {mod}`argparse` module, and each entry in this `parse_args` dict thus becomes a call to {meth}`add_argument() <argparse.ArgumentParser.add_argument>` from {class}`argparse.ArgumentParser`. When you run the workflow, snakebids adds the named argument values to the config dict, so your workflow can make use of it as if you had manually added the variable to your configfile.

Arguments that will receive paths should be given the item `type: Path`, as is done for `--derivatives` in the example above. Without this annotation, paths given to keyword arguments will be interpreted relative to the output directory. Indicating `type: Path` will tell Snakebids to first resolve the path according to your current working directory.

```{note}
`bids_dir` and `output_dir` are always resolved relative to the current directory and do not need any extra annotation.
```

BIDS apps also have a required `analysis_level` positional argument, so there are some config variables to set this as well. The analysis levels are in an `analysis_levels` list in the config, and also as keys in a `targets_by_analysis_level` dict, which can be used to map each analysis level to the name of a target rule:

```{literalinclude} step8/config.yml
:language: yaml
:caption: config.yml
:linenos:
:start-at: targets_by_analysis_level
:end-before: parse_args
:lineno-match:
```

Note: since we specified a `''` for the target rule, no target rule will be specified, so snakemake will just default to the first rule in the workflow.

Make the `run.py` script executable (`chmod a+x run.py`{l=bash}) and try running it now.

%TODO: add asciinema

The updated configfile is here (the Snakefile did not change in this step):

```{literalinclude} step8/config.yml
  :language: yaml
  :caption: config.yml
  :linenos:
```
